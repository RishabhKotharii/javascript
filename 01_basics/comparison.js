console.log(2>"1"); //here it converts datatype by itself 
console.log(null>0);
console.log(null==0);
console.log(null>=0); // only here it gives true in case of null

// === this is known as strict check 
console.log("2"===2);//here it will give false as it is strict chek so it will not convert its datatype
